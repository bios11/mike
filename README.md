# Face and Video Recognition using CNN, HOG, OpenCV, VS Code and Python
Simple Face and Video Recognition Machine Learning algorithm using Python and OpenCV

## Install all these Requirements
-  Python 3.6
- `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
-  Numpy
-  face_recognition
-  argparse
-  imutils
-  pickle
-  time

-  os
## Outline
This project consist of 4 parts, which are:
1. Training datasets (encode_faces.py)
2. Video Stream (recognize_faces_video.py)
3. Face Recognition (recognize_faces_image.py)
4. Video Upload	(recognize_faces_video_file.py)

You can run the code depending on your choice of project
Enjoying

## Tips
- If you don't understand what the code do, I already comments it line by line.
- You also can Google the syntax, and read the explanation from OpenCV Documentation.
